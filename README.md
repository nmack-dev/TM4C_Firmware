# TM4C_Firmware
* This repository contains firmware examples for the Texas Instruments TM4C123GXL LaunchPad Development Board. These examples are heavily based on the code examples/projects from the Embedded Systems - Shape The World course (https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/). 
* ~~Credit also goes to Shawn D'silva for providing a Linux-based toolchain for this development board (https://www.shawndsilva.com/blog/embedded%20systems/Getting-Started-with-TM4C-Launchpad-On-Linux.html).~~
* **UPDATE:** As of 12/07/2021, started using TI's Code Composer Studio for development due to easier debugging capabilities.
